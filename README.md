# interview-tests

##Why this repo

To keep track of my unattended interview tests and to serve as reference of my coding skills to future employees.

In order to protect the confidentiality of my clients, the original requirement of each test is not present in the repo.  

##General approach for all my exercises
- Stick to client requirements
- Do not over engineer the solution
- Have a `test first` approach
- The code should be `clean`, try to document it via tests and not using `java docs` or `comments`


##Tests

##maze
####Requirement
Implement a maze using `java`. Not all the features of a maze have been implemented, just stuck to client requirements.

####Tools and approach
- `java 8` and `maven` coding test
- `TDD` - `unit testing`
- `mockito` for mocking where necessary

####Complexity
Fairly complex test, might take few days to complete it.


##pass-management
####Requirement
Implement a pass management system using `REST APIs`, `java` and `spring boot`.
I had to build 4 APIs and use a database which had to persist data during application restarts.

####Tools and approach
- `java 8`, `spring boot 2` and `maven` coding test
- `TDD` - `unit testing`, `component testing`, `integration testing`
- `mockito` for mocking
- `spring-boot-test` for `component` and `integration` testing

####Complexity
Very complex test, might take few days to complete it.


##shopping-cart
####Requirement
Implement a shopping cart using `java`. Not all the features of a shopping cart have been implemented, just stuck to client requirements.

####Tools and approach
- `java 8` and `maven` coding test
- `TDD` - `unit testing`

####Complexity
Simple test, should not take more than 2 hours to complete it.
